\section{Course Website}
The course web site is at http://dephlo.org/pchemlab. Please become familiar with this site as soon as possible.

\section{Laboratory Materials}
The following items are required for this laboratory. The second two books are the same books required for CHEM350. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Exploring Chemistry with Electronic Structure Methods} by James B. Foresman and \AE leen Frisch, Second Edition, Gaussian, Inc. (1996). ISBN-10: 0963676938, ISBN-13: 978-0963676931.
\item \emph{Physical Chemistry} with MasteringChemistry by Thomas Engel and Phillip Reid, Third Edition, Prentice Hall (2013).  ISBN-13: 9780321766205
\item \emph{Quanta, Matter, and Change} by Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula, and Ronald Friedman, First Edition, W.H. Freeman and Company (2009). ISBN-10: 07167-6117-3, ISBN-13: 978-0-7167-6117-4.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Laboratory Prerequisites}
To take this laboratory course you must have passed one semester of physical chemistry that covers quantum mechanics. The easiest way to meet this prerequisite is to have credit for CHEM350. 

\section{Laboratory Content}
Chemistry 352 is an introduction to molecular modeling and electronic structure methods in chemistry using Gaussian 09. The emphasis is on answering chemical questions using available tools. The topics to be covered are listed in Table~\ref{tab:topics}. These may not be covered in this order, and not all topics will be covered with equal depth. 

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{\sffamily Topics covered in Chemistry 352.}
\label{tab:topics}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \toprule
Using Gaussian & Basis Sets \\
Specifying Molecular Structure & Selecting Methods \\
Energy Calculations & Chemical Reactivity \\
Geometry Optimization & Excited States \\
Frequency Calculations & Solutions \\ 
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Laboratory Goals}
This laboratory has several goals. Each action I take is designed to move us closer to achieving one or all of these goals. My goals in this laboratory are
\begin{enumerate}
\item To provide you with an overview of molecular modeling and electronic structure techniques for computing properties of molecules,
\item To give you practice carrying out molecular modeling and electronic structure calculations on molecules using a research-grade tool,
\item To make you better able to recognize, understand, and interpret molecular modeling and electronic structure results presented in the literature,
\item To make you better able to formulate chemical questions that can be answered with molecular modeling and electronic structure methods, and
\item To provide you with the tools to continue your education in chemistry in the very best graduate programs on planet Earth.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Teaching Philosophy}
I want you to grow as a learner and person in this laboratory. My actions are chosen to help you achieve that growth, and my actions are guided by a philosophy that can roughly be summarized in the following items.
\begin{itemize}
    \item You should be taught fundamental principles you cannot be expected to learn on your own so that you can build a foundation for understanding all the things in science and life that depend on these ideas.
    \item You should not be taught the things you can be expected to learn on your own by application of fundamental principles.
    \item You should receive guidance in developing an
    understanding of a subject in the context of what you already know,
    but you should not be told what to think about a subject.
    \item You should be forced to defend your ideas based on clearly reasoned arguments rooted in the reality of the theories that humanity has documented up to the present day.
    \item You should be encouraged to perform at the limits of your potential.
    \item You should be encouraged to learn how to teach yourself, which is ultimately the only useful skill you will take away from OWU.
\end{itemize}

\section{Laboratory Expectations}
You are expected to read all the assigned readings, to work all the assigned exercises, and to come to each laboratory meeting prepared to participate fully. You are expected to display a high level of independence and a strong willingness to solve problems through your own troubleshooting. In short, you are expected to be professional. It is also assumed that you are passionately interested in chemistry.

\section{Weekly Routine}
During laboratory meetings you will work on projects intended to illustrate particular concepts in computational chemistry and to challenge your problem solving abilities. A report will be due upon complete of each project. A pre-lab assignment will typically be assigned for each laboratory meeting. Laboratory meetings may involve some lecture, but I will try to keep those short. For the last one-third of the semester, laboratory meetings will be dedicated to work on a single independent project of your choosing. There will be no weekly pre-lab assignments or weekly reports for this part of the course. A detailed schedule can be found on the course website.

\section{Things I Grade}
You and I will determine your progress in this laboratory using the scores derived from evaluating your laboratory notebook, reports, final project, and final exam. This section provides details for each of these.

\subsection{Laboratory Notebook}
Each of you will maintain a laboratory notebook as a complete record of your work both in and out of the laboratory. All your work should be recorded in a laboratory notebook. Guidelines for keeping a laboratory notebook can be found on the course web site. I will evaluate your laboratory notebook and score it on a 100 point scale at least 4 times during the semester. Evaluations will take place at random times. Since your laboratory notebook will be kept as a Google document, I can evaluate your notebook at any time without warning.

\subsection{Reports}
For each laboratory project, you must complete a brief written report consisting of three sections: abstract, procedure, and results. Reports will be evaluated on a 100 point scale for clarity, presentation, and accuracy. Details for preparing reports and their due dates and times can be found on the course website.

\subsection{Final Project}
During the last third of the semester, laboratory meetings will be dedicated to work on a self-design final project. Your work on this final project must be presented in a formal written report and an oral presentation. The combination of your formal report, oral presentation, and supporting work will be evaluated on a 200 point scale with 100 points dedicated to the report and 100 points dedicated to the presentation. 

\subsection{Final Exam}
A final exam will be given during one of the time slots for MWF courses offered at 1, 2, or 3 p.m. The final exam will consist of practical questions about carrying out molecular modeling and electronic structure calculations. It sill also consist of a practical in which you have to carry out computations. 

\section{Things I Do Not Grade}
You will spend a lot of time completing pre-lab assignments, but there is no separate grade for pre-lab assignments. 

\section{Course Letter Grade}
Your course score, from which your course letter grade is derived, will be calculated as a weighted average of the scores you earn on evaluations of your laboratory notebook, reports, final project, and final exam. The weights to be applied to each evaluation item are shown in Table~\ref{tab:weights}.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{\sffamily Weight of items contributing to your final course grade.}
\label{tab:weights}
\begin{tabular}{r|l} \toprule
\textbf{Evaluation Item} & \textbf{Weight} \\ \hline
Laboratory Notebook & 25\% \\
Weekly Reports & 25\% \\
Final Project & 25\% \\
Final Exam & 25\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

At the end of the course your course score is translated into a course letter grade according to the procedure explained at dephlo.org/grades. 

The course letter grade you earn is not a reflection of your worth as a human being. If you work hard throughout the course and learn something about chemistry or yourself, the outcome is positive regardless of the letter grade earned. 

Your effort in this course is not a formal part of determining your course letter grade except as measured through performance. This will frustrate some of you. Keep in mind, however, that effort and attitude do matter if your course score is borderline. See dephlo.org/grades for more detail.
